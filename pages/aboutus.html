			 <h2>Background</h2>
			 <p style="line-height:40px;text-align:justify;">
			 Ten percent (10%) of the population are dyslexic; 4% severely so. Dyslexia is identified as a disability as defined in the Equality Act 2010. Many of the dyslexic people across the UK, whether adults or children, are unable to fulfil their potential as a large percentage of the population still do not understand what dyslexia is, the difficulties which the condition presents and do not know how best to support them. Dyslexia is not an obvious difficulty; it is hidden. As a result, dyslexic people have to overcome numerous barriers to make a full contribution to society.The Dyslexia SOS is the voice of dyslexic people. We aim to influence government and other institutions to promote a dyslexia friendly society, that enables dyslexic people of all ages to reach their full potential.The Dyslexia SOS promotes early identification of specific learning difficulties (SpLD) and support in schools to ensure opportunity to learn for dyslexic learners. In November 2007 at the Dyslexia SOS AGM Members agreed the policy on Early Identification of Specific Learning Difficulties. This forms the basis of Dyslexia SOS lobbying in this regard.

			 <h2>The Dyslexia SOS has three campaign areas:</h2>
			 <ol type="1">
			 <li>To encourage schools to work towards becoming dyslexia-friendly.</li>
			 <li>To reduce the number of dyslexic young people in the criminal justice system.</li>
			 <li>To enable dyslexic people to achieve their potential in the workplace.</li>
			 <li>To educate parents on the need to care for their wards</li>
			 </ol>
			 
			 <h2>Putting our values into action</h2>
			 
			 <p>
			  As an umbrella organisation, the Dyslexia SOS want dyslexic people to view the Dyslexia SOS as the organisation that best represents them. So the work of the Dyslexia SOS aims to reflect the values that dyslexic people hold dear. We will listen to, and act upon, the needs of dyslexic people. We will foster a feeling of togetherness for all of our membership and respect for dyslexic people, volunteers and staff. Our priorities include regional development, to support the growth of grassroots local dyslexia associations. We also want to grow the befriending network. Finally, we continue to develop dyslexia-friendly practice within the Dyslexia SOS and build a culture of total equality.
            </p>

			    In the 40 + years that the Dyslexia SOS has been campaigning there have been many changes in the world of dyslexia, some of them good. In light of this milestone, the Dyslexia SOS produced a report in 2012 looking back at the previous 40 years and made recommendations for the future.
